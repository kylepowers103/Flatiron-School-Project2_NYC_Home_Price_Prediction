# Project2

## As a property seller in Manhattan, what are factors that affect what you should price at?

### Datasets

We used NYC.gov's Rolling Sales data from the last 12 months, and 2 Zillow datasets: one showing all median prices and one of all square footage of properties sold. Both are in the year 2018. We merged all datasets together into a main dataframe.

### Data Cleaning

We filtered out all 0 value rows and extreme outliers.

### Transforming Data

When we plotted out our graphs, the normal distribution was postively skewed. We log transformed the data and the graph read much better.


### Checking Features for Usability
